		<h2>Dad Jokes</h2>
	</div>


	<p>The third Sunday in June is Father's Day. That's the day you have to laugh at his jokes. It's time to celebrate Dads and Dad Jokes. Wikipedia describes a dad joke as, "A dad joke is a pun or a question and answer that is often inoffensive and intended to elicit a groan." I describe a Dad joke as funny.</p>
	<p>This page was inspired by laughing with family and a recent event at my house. My wife recived an order of fabric, the bag was branded with a pun. "And Sew it begins." Knowing how my son felt about a good pun. I showed it to him. He smacked the shipping bag.<br> 
	Wife: "You hit my fabric!"<br>
	Son: "No, I punched the joke."</br>
    Me: "You punched the punchline." He didn't like that joke either.
</p>

	<p>So let's hear some Joookes! Pulled from the internet.
		<ul>
		<li>How did Darth Vader know what Luke was getting for his birthday? *
		He felt his presents.</li>
		
		<li>How do you follow Will Smith in the snow? * You follow the fresh prints.</li>
		<li>Why'd the alternate universe Spider-Man do so well on his driving test? He's an excellent parallel Parker</li>

		<li>I only seem to get sick on weekdays. I must have a weekend immune system. </li>
		<li>Of all the inventions of the last 100 years, the dry erase board has to be the most remarkable.</li>

		<h2>Dad Inspiration</h2>
	</div>
	<p>This site's colors were inspired by Dad's Root Beer branding. The red, blue, and yellow are colors from the cans and bottles. They are suppose to have their Dad's Root Beer Float Ice-cream, but I haven't found it in stores.<br>
	Tell your kids this classic joke, my Dad used. "This is my Root Beer, see it has my name on it, Dad's"
